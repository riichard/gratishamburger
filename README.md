# Get free hamburgers at McDonalds
McDonalds has a promotion that once you install the McDonalds app, you can claim a free hamburger. This is a clone of that app, as you guessed, **it will get you unlimited hamburgers** at McDonalds!

To use it, go to [http://gratishamburger.com/](http://gratishamburger.com/) and show the screen to the staff. This is where your social engineering skills come in to play, just pretend everything is normal and prepare for free dining.

## Success stories:
> I got free burgers for the entire class of 20 kids. I opened the app and shared the phone around with all the other kids. Worked like a champ. 
> - High School Student


> Order 5 burgers, take the buns off, and stack them together as one XXXXXL Hamburger.
> - Patrick Bateman
